# ft_irc - Internet Relay Chat Server

This is an implementation of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server in C++98. The project aims to create a server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously and implements the IRC protocol.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

1. **Basic Server Infrastructure**
   - Non-blocking socket operations
   - Multiple client handling using poll()
   - Clean connection management

2. **Authentication & Registration**
   - PASS command for server password authentication
   - NICK command with proper nickname validation
   - USER command for user registration
   - Complete registration sequence
   - Welcome messages

3. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid password detection
   - Nickname collision prevention
   - Invalid nickname format rejection
   - Proper registration sequence enforcement
   - Clean client disconnection handling

4. **Channel Operations**
   - JOIN command with operator status for channel creator
   - Channel key (password) protection
   - PART command for leaving channels
   - Channel message broadcasting (PRIVMSG)
   - NAMES command showing channel members and operators
   - KICK command with proper operator permission checks
   - TOPIC command for viewing and setting channel topics
   - INVITE command for inviting users to channels

5. **Channel Modes**
   - Invite-only mode (+i)
   - Topic restriction mode (+t)
   - Channel key mode (+k)
     - Setting and removing channel keys
     - Key validation and persistence
     - Special character support
     - Proper error handling

### Future Test Cases

1. **Channel Key Mode (+k)**
   - Key changes with different special characters
   - Key changes with spaces or other whitespace
   - Key changes with non-ASCII characters
   - Key changes with maximum length keys
   - Key persistence after server restart
   - Key changes during high server load
   - Key changes with multiple operators

2. **Channel Modes**
   - User limit mode (+l)
   - Ban mode (+b)
   - Voice mode (+v)
   - Operator mode (+o)
   - Multiple mode changes in one command
   - Mode persistence after server restart

3. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid mode syntax
   - Invalid mode parameters
   - Mode changes on non-existent channels
   - Mode changes by non-operators
   - Mode changes with invalid permissions

## Building the Project

```bash
make        # Build the project
make re     # Rebuild the project
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and executable
```

## Running the Server

```bash
./ircserv <port> <password>
```
Example:
```bash
./ircserv 6667 password
```

## Testing the Current Implementation

You can test the server using netcat (nc). Here's a step-by-step testing guide:

### 1. Basic Connection Test
```bash
nc localhost 6667
```

### 2. Registration Sequence Test
```bash
# Connect and try to set nickname without authentication (should fail)
NICK testuser
# Expected: Error 451 - Not registered

# Try wrong password (should fail)
PASS wrongpassword
# Expected: Error 464 - Password incorrect

# Use correct password
PASS password
# Expected: No response (success)

# Set nickname
NICK testuser
# Expected: No response if successful

# Complete registration
USER testuser 0 * :Real Name
# Expected: Welcome message (001)
```

### 3. Channel Operations Test
```bash
# Create and join a channel (becomes operator)
JOIN #testchannel
# Expected: Join confirmation and NAMES list with @ symbol

# Create a channel with a key
JOIN #secretchannel secretkey
# Expected: Join confirmation and NAMES list with @ symbol

# Try to join with wrong key
JOIN #secretchannel wrongkey
# Expected: Error 475 - Cannot join channel (+k) - bad key

# Set a channel topic (as operator)
TOPIC #testchannel :Welcome to the test channel!
# Expected: Topic change broadcast to channel

# Set user limit mode (as operator)
MODE #testchannel +l 5
# Expected: Mode change broadcast to channel

# Try to join when channel is full
JOIN #testchannel
# Expected: Error 471 - Cannot join channel (+l) - channel is full

# Remove user limit mode
MODE #testchannel -l
# Expected: Mode change broadcast to channel

# View channel topic
TOPIC #testchannel
# Expected: RPL_TOPIC (332) with the current topic

# Try to set topic without operator status
TOPIC #testchannel :This should fail
# Expected: Error 482 - Not channel operator

# Try to view topic without joining
TOPIC #testchannel
# Expected: Error 442 - You're not on that channel

# Kick someone as operator
KICK #testchannel target :you are kicked
# Expected: Kick message broadcast to channel
```

## Error Codes

- 331: No topic is set
- 332: Channel topic
- 353: NAMES reply

- 451: Not registered
- 461: Not enough parameters
- 462: Already registered
- 464: Password incorrect
- 475: Cannot join channel (+k) - bad key
- 482: Not channel operator
